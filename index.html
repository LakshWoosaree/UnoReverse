									<h2><a href="#">The Journey</a></h2>
									<p>If you are about to read this, you are a brave soul. Whether reading paragraphs of my thoughts is worth your time is for you to decide. My name is Laksh Woosaree and I was part of Ross Sheppard's graduating class in 2019. For the vast majority that already know me, it probably is no surprise that my over-the-top self decided to make an entire website for a grad quote. For those that do not know me… Well I think this website speaks for itself. 

										I truly feel like highschool is one of the most pivotal moments in most people's life. It dictates the next couple decades of your life and as much as we comfort ourselves in saying “Grade 10 won't matter in 10 years,” there is only a limited truth to that. Yes. Grade 10 marks won't matter in 10 years but your decisions surely will. If you did not find a subject you were passionate about in grade 10, I can assure you that you spent more time at Westmount Mall than in school - or maybe under some pine trees… This missed opportunity only cascades onto the following years and soon enough by the time you graduate you find yourself working fast-food or retail because you did not have an interest in pursuing post-secondary. Or you drop out of school and you become filthy rich via entrepreneurship...statistically not the latter.  Let's step back for a moment though because on the contrary, if you are like me, you put your heart and soul into school and grinded out three-grueling years of highschool. Maybe you grinded too hard, saw a goal and let it slip away. You are at the end of it all and you look back and it was all for what? A sexy looking transcript? Well… Yeah that's about it honestly. Do not get me wrong, the sheer passion and knowledge acquired from being that academic tryhard is pretty cool as you have a vast selection of knowledge to flex on the peasants. The consequence however is realizing the moments you missed out on. Wanted to learn a new sport, play a new instrument, master a new skill? Yikes. Unfortunately you won't have time for that. Of course there are a few anomalies who run off of caffeine to pull off such a feat - the likes of Steven Vuong (Better known as Trash Deluxe) Regardless, there are trade-offs at the least. In retrospect I would definitely have picked up at least one sport and continue playing in band and jazz-band if I did not prioritize academics as much as I did. I am sure I have a legion of friends from Discord prepared to call me out on my extensive hours playing video games - namely Fortnite. Which I would argue was the bi-product of dropping sports and music as the result of being confined in my house which limited the activities I could do. Gaming became an inevitable habit that intertwined with studying - famously me studying while playing a game (it is more effective than you might think.) So yes I have been rambling on and I make it seem like I regret my decisions to limit my skill because of my extensive desire to over achieve - and yeah I do regret it. The reason why I regret it though is not because I missed out on developing skills - because I did. I learnt on my own time. The thing I regret is not enjoying what I was doing. I was so caught up and methodical in everything I did. I learnt to ace tests every single time and I forgot about what learning was about: making mistakes and discovering. If I were to go back, I would not have spent the entire class on my quizzes. I would have let the mistakes happen and then enjoy the liberation of not being stressed about finding the nuisances in each question - save that for unit tests and finals because that's when they matter. Quizzes barely touch your mark and when they do, most teachers are more than happy to mitigate their effects if they truly do. If any teacher is reading this, they are probably smirking as they urge to slyly tell me “I told you so.” Yeah, you were right. It is alright though, a small cost to pay for realization. In turn, if I were to give advice to anyone still in highschool, stop stressing about school. Make the most out of it and enjoy your time. Study when you must and maybe skip a couple classes...strategically though. Finesse teachers to avoid absences because believe it or not teachers reward hard working students with leniency - or maybe trust. Oh...yikes. DO NOT take that advice out of proportion though because you should get your work done. As we all know though, a ton of classes you get nothing productive done. I strongly believe it is beneficial to take a few minutes out of class to have some fun and be able to return and be productive even for 30 minutes. Teachers, you know I am right. Nobody gets work done in class during “work periods.”  Anyways, for you annoying pests that followed up and read my grad quote, you must be thinking “bruh you said to stop regretting your past” yet I'm standing here saying that I regret my damn past decisions. Deep breath. Big yikes. Alright. The thing is I really don't in the grand scheme of things. I regret the choices but the realization of this entire thing only comes from me making that mistake. I guess using my hard earned English 30-1 skills: High School was only a quiz for me. The future will be my unit test.<p></p>
										
										<p></p>Dramatic. I know. The other two tabs on this website are other outlooks that I possess through the experiences I had throughout highschool. The second being perhaps life advice to anyone and the third being a collection of songs that followed my highschool year. Contacts to my Discord, Email, and Instagram are below. If you need to reach me please feel free to via the links below. Regardless, below are a series of images depicting the extreme level of cringe that I embody from time to time.
