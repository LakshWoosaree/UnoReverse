									<p>Rock bottom. 
										Ah yes. 
										Bedrock. 
										Why do people think every time they are low in life they are at rock bottom? Probably because through their crippling depression they have attempted to pacify their emotions by creating their utopian reality on a virtual machine on a 32 bit application. By that I mean they have been playing Minecraft for too many hours and dug a 100 by 100 pit into the ground and have officially hit rock bottom -literally-  after months of work.

								<p>For those that did not understand a word I said, congratulations, you have a life! Really though, that was my way of transitioning into my advice to everyone. 
								</p>
								<p>There will always be times in life that are unfavorable. Times that you wish never happened. Times that you wish would end. Times that push you to your limits. It is part of life. I think one of the most important things is that during those times you take a break from the world and look around. The world is still there for you. Take your time. Emotions have expiry dates. You learn to forgive. You learn to give again. You learn to love again. It is these exact times that you feel at your lowest that develop your character. It becomes a part of you - the reason why you are unique. It is important to not let these things go as they teach you who you are - what you become. It does not mean that your past shapes you. You choose how it shapes you. You have a choice to either pick yourself up or let yourself down. At the end of the day though it does not matter if you crawl or run to the finish line, what matters is that you do not stop. You will finish. There is always an end to everything that begins. Nothing is meant to last. So make the most out of it before it ends.
								</p>
								<p>Take risks. Be reckless. Let it go when it is time. Recalibrate. Do it again.
